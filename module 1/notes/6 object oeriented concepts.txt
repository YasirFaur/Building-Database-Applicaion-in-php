This lecture is about Object-Oriented Programming, OOP, in PHP.

In old PHP versions, there were only many functions like date add and date create. This was not well organized.
Starting from PHP 5, and now in PHP 7, PHP became much better with OOP.

The main idea of OOP is simple.
A program has data, like variables and arrays, and code, like loops and functions.
OOP puts data and code together inside a box called an Object.
Each object has its own data and code. This makes programs easier to organize. This idea is called encapsulation.

Important words:
Class is like a template or a cookie cutter.
Object or Instance is the real cookie, made from the template.
Method is a function inside an object.
Attribute is a variable inside an object.

So, OOP is about using templates, called Classes, to create many objects that share the same code but can have different data.

Key terms to remember:

1. Class = Template or Blueprint
2. Object, Instance = Real thing created from a class
3. Method = Function inside a class
4. Attribute = Variable inside a class
5. new = Command to create a new object
